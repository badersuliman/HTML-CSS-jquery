        <div class="rtext">Method:
            <div>In the Najdi region, the best types of
                wheat grain are used such as the Turkish variety.
                Those making the dish then wash a cup and a quarter of wheat
                and soak it in water for a while.
                They mix it with a quarter of a cup of Egyptian rice
                that is also washed and soaked. Then they cut white onions and add hot peppers
                according to taste. After that, a chicken is cleaned and cut into
                small pieces and then boiled.

                Two cans of milk is also used;
                the secret is to use slightly almost expired milk
                to increase acidity. Then a special Jareesh spice mix is
                added; if not available, then Maggi, salt, cumin, turmeric,
                cardamom and cinnamon are added for a tasty dish.

                The dish enters the oven for
                90 minutes on a gentle heat and stirred occasionally.
                During this time, tamarind is soaked and filtered.
                At the same time, an onion, black lemon and ghee are
                cooked over a hot pan .After the Jareesh is cooked, lemon,
                cream and powdered milk are added, then the dish is stirred
                vigorously with a special tool until its ingredients are homogeneous.
                To finish off, a well is created in the middle of the dish where the
                soaked tamarind and spiced onion mixture are added.</div>
